- sqlite3 app.db

## Overview
This project appears to be a database-related application, as indicated by the presence of database files (`app.db-shm`, `app.db-wal`) and a markdown file (`db_3_python.md`).

## Files
- `.DS_Store`: A macOS system file that stores custom attributes of a folder.
- `app.db-shm`: Shared memory file used by SQLite for database operations.
- `app.db-wal`: Write-ahead log file used by SQLite for database operations.
- `db_3_python.md`: Documentation file for the project.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have SQLite installed on your system.
2. Open the database files using an SQLite client to inspect the database schema and data.

## Usage
- The database files (`app.db-shm`, `app.db-wal`) are used by SQLite for efficient database management.
- The `db_3_python.md` file contains documentation and notes related to the project.
